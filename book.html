A SYSTEMATIC COURSE OF MELODIC COMPOSITION, DESIGNED 
FOR THE USE OF YOUNG MUSIC STUDENTS, 
CHIEFLY AS A COURSE OF EXERCISE COLLATERAL WITH 
THE STUDY OF HARMONV

<h1>PREFACE</h1> 

<p>The object of this course of musical discipline is, to assist the voung 
student (whether or not he expects to become a composer) to form and to 
cultivate habits of correct melodic thought.</p>

<p>It is simply a carefully graded course of exercise in melody-invention, — nor 
conception. The agencies which conduce to the transition from the former 
into the latter are touched upon in paragraphs 125 to 129, which maybe briefly 
scanned, here, without harm.</p>

<p>The reasons for urging such a course of technical practice upon students 
of music (general, as well as special students) are two-fold: </p>

<p>1st, because the prime object of all theoretical study in music is, or should 
be, melody. A thorough apprehension of the conditions of correct melody, 
and command of its natural laws, pave the way to the full and easy reception 
of all other phases of discipline in music ; they are the only natural preparation 
for successful studies in sight-reading, harmony, counterpoint, form, instru- 
mentation and interpretation.</p>

<p>2nd, because all musical practice, productive or reproductive, in common 
with all other operations of mind and body, is the result of habit, and is there- 
fore qualified exactly according to the quality and energy of the habits which 
have been contracted, by accident or intention, in early life. The effort to con- 
trol the formation of these habits, and guide them as early as possible into 
proper channels, is therefore obviously the most valuable that a wise educa- 
tional purpose can induce.</p>

<p>Whether there are laws governing melodic conduct, or not, is a question 
to which an answer will be found in the book itself.</p>


<p>It is to be inferred from the above, that the best results will be gained by
beginning this course of excercise early in life. Not, however, as a rule, before 
the twelfth or thirteenth year.</p>

<p>It may be pursued before Harmony is taken up, or entirely independent 
of the latter. But it will probably prove most efficient as collateral study, 
<i>interlined between the excercises of any standard text book on Harmony;</i> either
from the beginning, or in the later course of harmonic study; in regular alter- 
nation with chapters of the latter, or interlined strictly according to subjects. </p>

<p>The degree of benefit to be derived, is manifestly proportionate to the 
degree of thoroughness with which each lesson is exercised,-— precisely as pro- 
ficiency in scales of any other item of pianoforte technique depends upon the 
number of times each movement is thoughtfully repeated. It is a system of 
drill, which must be persisted in until its aim, — <i>the fixing of habits</i>, — is 
achieved. For this reason, the course should cover a full year. </p>

<p>The musical illustrations have been made unusually copious, because this 
particular phase of musical education is likely to be absorbed by the pupil 
quite as readily through sensuous contact with melodic sounds, as by mental 
induction. Therefore, they are to be studied as faithfully as the text, <i>both at, 
and away from</i>, the keyboard. </p>

ESSENTIAL TONES.

<h3>CHAPTER I. 
MAJOR. THE SCALE-LINE, REGULAR.</h4>

<p>
    <p>1. Any series of single tones is a Melody. The quality of the melody 
    depends upon the choice and duration of each successive tone. The general 
    conditions of good melody are: </p>

    <p>Coherency, throughout each chain of three or four 
    successive tones; </p>

    <p>Unity, in the design and effect of the complete 
    melodic sentence; and </p>

    <p>Interesting movements, exhibiting sufficient variety to banish every trace of monotony. </p>
</p>

<p>2. The choice of successive tones (aside from the question of durations) 
is subject, fundamentally, to two Primary Rules of melodic movement. </p>

<p>First Primary Rule.</p>

<p>3. A melody may follow the line of the 

MAJOR SCALE, 

upward or down/ward, with almost 
unlimited freedom. 

This yields the smooth species of movement called diatonic, conjunct, 
or step-wise progression. 
</p>



<p>4. Step-wise progression are regular, and consequently invariably per-
missible, when they confirm the <i>natural or inherent melodic inclination of the
so called Active scale steps</i> (par. 6)</p>

<p>5. The seven steps of every scale are divided into two classes:
The 2st, 3rd and 5th scale-steps (thos which constiture the Tonic
Triad, or harmonic core of the key, see par.18) are <i>Inactive</i> They occupy
the center of harmonic repose, and are therefore inert, not moving except in
obedience impulse to regain the condition of rest. For illustration:

           <source src="sound/examples/ex1.mp3" />  
        </audio> 
    </p>
</p>

<p>6. The direction and the degree of urgency, of the movement are
dictate by the location of each Active scale-step, and its proximity to the 
nearest inactive or central scale-step, -- as follow:
(a) The tendency is most urgent in the <b><i>7th</i></b> scale-step and its direction is
<b><i>upward</i></b>.
(b) The tendency is somewhat less urgent in the <b><i>6th</i></b> step, and its direction
is <b><i>downward</i></b>.
(c) Still less urgent in the <b><i>4th</i></b> step, and its direction is <b><i>downward</i></b>.
(d) The inclination of the 2nd scale-step is evenly balanced between the 1st and 3rd steps,
from which it is (practically) equally distant. For that reason it need not be considered in this connection

called its Resolution.

THE 4:-MEASURE PHRASE. 

8. The smallest complete melodic sentence, called the Phrase, gen- 
erally embraces four ordinary measures. 

(a) When regular, it begins with one of the (inactive) tones which con- 
stitute the Tonic Triad. These may be placed upou the first (accented) 
beat of the first measure; or one, perhaps more, beats be/ore the first full 
measure. If the Phrase begins, thus, with one or more preliminary tones, 
their value is to be subtracted trom the final measure. 

(b) The Phrase closes with the Tonic (i.e., the key-note); upon an 
accented beat of the fourth measure (upon either accent, if a compound 
measure) ; and preceded by either of the three tones which constitute 
the Dominant Triad (see par. 19). This ending is called the Perfect 
Cadence.

aoaleetep [namely, from the 7th, 6th or 4th, — as stated in par. 6d, the 2nd 

seale-sfc p is aol Bnbjecl to any of the rules of aetive steps), the consaqnenoea 

depend upon 1 1 1 < - direction of the leap. No subsequent consideration is 

-:irv if the melody makes the leap in the proper direction (from tho 

tale-step upward, from the 6th or 4th step downward, as is to be 

done in the present lesson). For illustration:

LESSON 1. 

A cumber of original melodies (at least one in each key), with strict 
regard to the following limitations and directions: 

(1) Only in major keys. 

(2) Without modulations, — i. e., each melody in one key throughout. 

(3) As 4-measuie Phrases, according to the models of Ex. 4. 

(4) In 2/2, 2/4, 3/2, 3/4, 3/8, 4/4, 4/8, 6/8, and G/4-measure, successively. 

(5) The rhythm strictly uniform, i. e., one tone to each beat, as P, f or 
f, according to the chosen measure, — excepting the final cadence-tono 
(see Ex. 4). 

(6) The scale-line, tone-repetitious, and an occasional skip of a third 
are to be employed. Of the latter, only one at a time (perhaps returning, 
as shown in Ex. G),— not two successive leaps in the same direction. 

(7) No violation of the natural tendency of Active scale-steps is per- 
mitted in this lesson. Each is to move in the proper direction. Examples 
2 and Gb. 

Note — The work should bo, at present, merely the mechanical application of the given 
rules; these rules are to become habits,— formed and established, as habits are, by persistent 
systematic effort. After regular, collect melodic movement has become a habit of thought, the 
tones will soon invest themselves, more or less unconsciously, with feeling and purpose; and all 
Sxceptional progressions will lie likely to rectify or justify themselves. 

At the same time, the student intttl endeavor to hear each tone as he writes it down, without 
the aid of an instrument, and must not desist until he can thus mentally follow, accurately, every 
melodic movement. Further, each melody, when completed, must lie sung, and then tested at 
the key-board, — but not until completed ; the invention must bo prosecuted away from any in- 
strument.

* Somewhat loss objectionable, because the tendency of the 4th scale-step is less urgent 
than that of tlio other Active tones (par. Gc). 

In other words, the melody, in pursuing the line of the scale upward, may 
turn back (if desired) at any point excepting the 7th scale-step; in pursuing 
the line of the scale downward, it can turn at any point excepting the 6th 
or 4th step. 

1 2. As intimated in par. 9 b, the skip of a third may be made in either 
direction, even from an Active scale-step. An obligation is involved only 
when the leap of a third is made contrary to the natural tendency of the 
Active tone; in which case the melody must immediately turn back, — either 
by a leap, to the preceding tone, or by step-wise progression. For illus- 
tration :

LESSON 2. 

A number of original 4-measuve melodies (at least one in each major 
key), according to all the directions of the preceding lesson, excepting (7); 
both the regular and irregular progressions of the Active scale-steps are to 
be employed. The danger of monotony, arising from the uniformity of 
rhythm, must be counteracted by variety of tone-succession; avoid moving 
about in the narrow compass of the same 3 or 4 tones, and, as a rule, avoid 
returning too frequently to the same tone, especially on corresponding beats 
of consecutive measures.

FUNDAMENTAL HARMONIC PRINCIPLES. 

17. Each key comprises three classes or families of chords, called 
respectively the 

Tonic class; 

Dominant class; and 

Second- Dominant or Sub- Dominant class. 

18. The Tonic class consists of two chords, one erected upon the first 
scale-step, or Tonic note, and called the Tonic Triad or " Tlie One" (marked 
1) ; and one of subordinate rank erected upon the sixth scale-step, and called 
" Tlte Six" (marked VI); the latter is much less common than the I. These 
Tonic chords are limited to three Tones, — hence their title " Triad." Thus, 
in C-major: 



Ex. 12. 



i

O Major. 



m 



Subordinate Tonic Triad, or VI. 
O Major. 



J

19. (a) The Dominant class consists of a cluster of chords erected 
upon the fifth scale-step, or Dominant. These chords may embrace as many 
as five tones, the lowermost of which (the root) is often omitted. They are 
erected and named as follows in C-major:

Summary (C-major) 

1. Tonic claaa. 



Ex.15 




N. B.— This table must be reproduced in every major key, daily for a time, at the 
key-board, and in writing. 

21. The few primary rules which govern the succession, or move- 
ments, of these chord-classes are as follows: 

(a) The chords of the Tonic class may progress into (i. e., may be fol- 
lowed by) any other chord of the same key. 

(b) The chords of the Dominant class can only progress easily into those 
of the Tonic class, preferably into the I, more rarely into the VI. The pro- 
gression of a Dominant chord into one of the Second-Dominant class is 
uncommon, and need not be considered in melody-invention. 

( c) The chords of the Second-Dominant class pass most readily into those 
of the Dominant class; but they may also be followed by those of the Tonic. 

22. N.B. — Tliese rules of chord-succession, are so fully confirmed by the 
rules of inherent melodic tendency (explained in paragraphs 4-6), that careful 
observance of the latter facilitates, largely, the correct application of the former, 

23. Nevertheless, it is necessary to be fully conscious of the qnality 
and name of the chord-lines represented by skips in the melody, and to con- 
trol their movements accordingly. 



KULES FOR SINGLE SKIPS. 

24. Each single skip must obviously represent, at present, some good 
chord. For example (C-major) :

20. The leap of a Third (called a "narrow" skip), as has been seen, is 
always permissible. Any larger leaps than this (called "wide" skips) are- 
subject to the following general condition: 

After a wide skip (i. e., any distance beyond a third) the melody is very 
likely to turn, and progress, by scale or chord-line, in the opposite direction. 
Thus:

27. (a) If the melody, however, violates this rule, by continuing in 
the same direction after a wide skip along the line of the scale, it should, as a, 
rule, pass on only one step, and then turn. In other words, while it is 
always more natural to turn back immediately after a wide leap, it is usually 
sufficiently correct to do so at the second following tone. Thus:

(b) At the same time, if the scale-tone that follows the skip in the same 
direction chances to be one of the Active tones, it is more than likely to 
assert its natural tendency and resolve properly, — in which case the rule of 
" tarniug, after a wide leap " will be evaded altogether. Thus: 



Ex. 20. |= 




See Ex. 21-1. * 



* These two progressions aro doubtful in any case, for they involve a violation of both the 
rule of par. 6 a, and that of par. 26.

LESSON 3. 



A large number of original 4-measure Melodies, in all major keys, and 
in all the species of measure prescribed in Lesson 1. The rhythm uniform. 
The scale-line and skips of a 3rd to be used as before; and, besides these, 
single wide skip* (i. e., each wide skip followed by the scale-line, or by a 
narrow leap) may occur, according to the above rules. Sing, and play, each 
melody when completed. 



CHAPTER IV. 

THE CHORD-LINE, CONTINUED. 

31. Review par. 13, and Ex. 11. If the melody is to continue, after a 
wide skip, with another skip in the same direction (contrary to the general 
principle of par. 26), it may pass into any tone which harmonizes with the tones 
of the preceding skip, — and so on, as far as the skips extend in the same 
direction. This rule represents simply the application of the second Pri- 
mary Rule (par. 13) in a broader sense. For example:

This progression is checked, in each case, both by par. G (the inherent ten- 
dency of the first tone), and by par. 28 b (the irregular leap to an Active 
tone). It is, however, possible to justify it as derivation from the line of 
the Incomplete Dominant-7th chord (Ex. 13), if it is an entirely obvious

self for awhile to the strict oDservance of the fundamentzi rules, and the regular modes 
of melodic conduct, he can encounter no difficulty or embarrassment: namely, the two 
Primary Rules, paragraphs 3 and 13, — 

Movement along the Scale-lino or Chord-line' 
and, besides these, paragraph 4, — 

Proper Resolution of the Active Scale-steps; 
paragraph 10, — 

Overcoming natural tendency, by approaching the tone, along the scale, in cor- 
responding direction; 
paragraph 24, — 

Each single skip representing some good Chord-line; 
paragraph 26, — 

Changing the direction, after a wide leap; 
paragraph 28 a,— 

Approaching an Active tone in the direction opposite to that of its Resolution; 
and paragraph 31, — 

Successive leaps in same direction representing a good collective chord-effect. 
These few rules practically suffice for primary melodic conduct, and, once firmly 
established in the mind of the pupil, as habits of melodic thought, all exceptional and 
irregular forms of melodic succession will be found to follow as a matter of course, and 
regulate themselves, sooner or later.

CHAPTER V. 

MINOR. 

40. The true minor mode, that is, the "harmonic form, corresponds to 
the major scale of the same key-note, excepting that the 6th and 3d %oah* 
etept art fettered a ohromatia half-step. Tims: 



C-major.

All melodic and harmonic movements in minor are regulated npon the 
basis of this, the harmonic, form of the scale. Before proceeding farther, 
the student must familiarize himself absolutely with this derivation. Every 
minor scale must he written out, according to Ex. 37, and played repeatedly. 
And tho table of Ex. 15 is also to be written out in every minor mode (with 
lowered 3rd and 6th steps). 

41. All the Scale-conditions and Chord-conditions of the major mode, 
explained in the preceding four chapters, are therefore similarly valid for 
minor, — with a few self-evident limitations, as follows: 

42. The most noteworthy limitation for minor melodies, is an excep- 
tion to par. 10, as far as the 6th and 7th scale-steps are concerned. These 
should not appear in immediate succession, as a very general rule. Ex. 7, 
measures 1 and 2, are therefore only valid in C-major, — not in C-minor 
(Ex. 7, measure 3, however, is not involved in this restriction). Thus: 



Ex. 38. 



7 , ? ? ? 6 



m 



6 ? ? ? 7 , 



^il^^^l 



C -minor. The flat is inserted before a for greater clearness. 



This also affects a portion of Ex. 17, Ex. 20, Ex. 22, and a portion of 
Ex. 28, — no others. ■ 

43. This succession is nevertheless possible, though very rare, as obrior.:? 
derivation from the chord-line of the Diminished-7th chord (i. e., the Domi- 
nant-9th chord, in the minor mode, incomplete, — Ex. 15, chord no. 7, with 
a?). Thus: 



Better (par. 28 a): 




44. Further, — an additional augmented fourth occurs in minor, formed 
by leaping from the 6th scale-step up to the 2nd stej); and vice versa, from 
the 2nd step down to the 6th step. Thus : 



Ex. 40. 



The flat before a is, 
of course, superfluous. 



This progression, like that of Ex. 29, is checked either by the irregu- 
larity of carrying the 6th scale-step upward (par. 6 6), or of leaping down 
upon it, in the direction of its Resolution (par. 28 6). 

And, like the former, and like the irregularity of Ex. 38, it is possible

A large number of 4-measure melodies, in all the minor keys, and all 
the species of Measure prescribed in Lesson 1. Rhythm uniform. All 
details precisely as in Lesson 4. Avoid monotony. 



CHAPTER VI. 

DIVERSITY OF RHYTHM. REGULAR. 

46. The rhythmic effect of a melody may be heightened by employing 
tones of different time-values (instead of uniform beats, as in the preceding 
chapters). 

(a) The disposition of these values is Regular, 

"When the comparatively longer (i. e., heavier) tones occupy 
the accented beats, or accented beat-fractions ; and, vice versa, 
■when the comparatively shorter (i. e., lighter) tones occupy 
unaccented beats, or beat-fractions. Thus:

■\~ . It is geserallj advisable to moid oaing extreme time-values in the 

Phrase-melody. For instance, in 9 1 or I 1 measure, J-notea (as ram 

of two boats) anil v*- notes (as simple division) may both occur; — occasionally 

. dotted half-note, or ■ 16th-note; bnt the whole note would be rare, and 
82nd-notea almosl onl of the question. In other words, the beats indicated 
in the signature should constitute the fundamental or average tune-value

The " triplet " will be regarded, at present, as 6/8 or 9/8 Measure. 

49. Rests represent, commonly, the suppression of a portion of one of 
the original tones; — generally an unaccented fraction, in -which case the Eest 
follows the tone; sometimes, however, an accented fraction, in which case the 
Rest precedes the tone which it represents, and as the equivalent of which it 
ia to be treated. For illustration (the slurs indicate which tones the rests 
are borrowed from) :

CHAPTER VII. 

Till- PERIOD-FORM. 

fW. Tho "Period" generally embraoee s mennureR; that is, tirn phrases, 
of J meaanree each. The first of these ie called tho Antecedent, the second 
one the Consequent Phra a 

51. (n) T: • !' '■ : e 1. gins BXaotly like any sinplo Phrase, 

aooording to par. 8a Put it enda, not with the Perfect oadenoe (8 6), but 
witli a so-called Semioadenoe, — upon an aooented beal of 1 1 1 . - lth measure, 
wtik >~ith<n- one of ike three tonee which eompoee the Dominant Trim!. 

(b) The Consequent Phrase follows, USUallj beginning on the same fseat 
with which the Antecedent began, ami ending, like any single Phra.se, with 



EX*BCIS«8 IK MEXODY-WIUTINU. 



35 



the Perfect cadence, — upon an accented beat of the final (8th) measure, with 
the Tonic note. Thus (in C-major) : 



(Accented or nnacc. beg.) 




Ex.48. 



52. In the first few examples invented, the Consequent Phrase must 
correspond to the melody of the Antecedent, excepting the last 3 or 4 tones; 
these always differ, because of the diversity of cadence. The formation of 
such Period-melodies is called "parallel construction." For illustration:

See also, Ex. 52, No. 1 ; Ex. 53, No. 2. 

53. In each succeeding example, the extent of this similarity between 
the Phrases is to be diminished gradually, — more and more tones in measure 
7, then 6, and then 5, are to differ from those of measure 3, then 2, and then 
1; until, finally, the entire Consequent Phrase is independent of its Ante- 
cedent. This ultimate formation is called the Period of "contrasting con- 
struction. " Thus:

LESSON 8. 

A large number of B DM inn melodies, in Period-form, according to 
par. 51; at Brst, several in parallel construction (pur. 52), end then gradu- 
ally more and more contrasting (pur. 53). 

Rhythm diversified (but regular); all tho species of Measure preeoribed

may be inserted, chiefly :it (after) the semioadenoe. 

n the note to Lesson 1; and par. 39. Avoid monotony. Sing, and 
then play, eftoh melody, when completed. 



After correction, somo of these Period-melodies mny bo harmonized. 
Whore the Construction is parallel, the harmonization of tho Consequent may 
differ from that of tho (melodically similar) Antecedent. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

IRREGULAR RHYTHM. 

B4i B iew pur. 46a, thoroughly. 

The disposition of various timo-valucs is Irregtdar, •when the conditions 
of Regular rhythm are violated, namely, 

When the heavier (comparatively longer) tones in a measure oc- 
cupy comparatively tight bents or be a t fractions of that measure; 
and, vice versa, when the tighter tones (brief, subdivisions of beats) 
occupy comparatively heavier pulses in the group.

longer than, or at least as Zon<7 as, any other tone in the same group (measure), 
the rhythmic disposition is Regular, — otherwise Irregular.

LESSON 9. 

A large number of 4-measure and 8-measure melodies, with Irregular 
rhythmic measures, according to the above rules, — particularly par. 56. It 
will be well to limit this exercise to occasional rhythmic irregularities, 
introduced in Phrases or Periods of an otherwise regular and simple design. 
Extreme irregularities (par. 55) should be avoided. 

Use the varieties of Measure prescribed in Lesson 1; different major 
and minor keys, alternately. 

At first, experiment with former melodies, modifying their rhythm 
without altering the tones. Then invent new ones, with immediate ref- 
erence to Irregular rhythm.

of falling upon an accent (first beat of the group) us prescribed. In this

next lower, scale-step, as obvious grace-note. Thus:

CHAPTER X. 



SYNTAX OF MELODY. 

59. The succession of tones in a Phrase or Period-melody, may be 
determined by a broader consideration than the application of given rules 
to each single unit of the melodic succession; namely, — by the principle of 
symmetrical recurrence, applied to an entire group of consecutive tones. 

The recurrence, or reproduction of the group, may assume the form — 

(1) Of an exact Repetition; or 

(2) Of a Sequence. 

60. The " Repetition " is a literal recurrence, upon the self-same scale- 
steps. Thus : 

1. Moderate. Folk-Sono.

and, in any case, it ia almost certain to correspond <<> the fundamental rhythmic

the meaaure. For illustration:

63. Tho recurrences, by Repetition or Sequence, may take placo at any 
point in the Phrase or Period; though they are most common at the begin- 
ning, — and, in any case, thus* represent corresponding rhythmic pulses (beats 
or measures), as indicated in the last clause of par. 56. 

In Ex. 49, measure 3 is a soqnenoe of measure 2 (threo steps lower) , and measures 5, 6 and 
7 are the repetition of measures 1, 2 and 3, that constitute the "parallel construction" of the 
whole Period. In Ex. 50, measure 2 is a sequence of measure 1, and measure 7 a sequence of 
i C. In Ex. 53, No. 1, measure 6 ie a repetition of measure 2. 



64. Besides the obvious structural merit of such unified formations, 
there is another important and peculiar advantage involved, namely: 

The recurrence of a group of tones, by repetition or sequence, 
serves to rectify, or at least to justify, almost any irregularities 
of melodic succession which may occur, 

(1) At the point of contact of the symmetrical groups, or, 

(2) During the sequential recurrence of any perfectly faultless 
initial group. 

This rule is analogoiis to that of par. 56, in reference to the amelioration 
of irregularities of rhythm, — by symmetrical recurrence. For illustration:

CHAPTER XI. 

MELODIC SYNTAX, CONTINTJED. 

REPETITION AND SEQUENCE, MODIFIED. 

GO. The recurrences of tone-groups, both as repetition and as sequence, 
need not bo thus exact, as shown in the preceding chapter, but may bo 
modified, or varied, Rlightly (not to such an extent as to render their recog- 
nition difficult or uncertain), as follows: 

(a) By adding one or more intermediate tones; — possibly, also, by 
omitting particles of the initial group ; 

(b) By altering one or another of the original intervals of melodic 
succession, — widening a step-wise progression to a narrow leap, or a nar- 
row loop to a wider one, and vice versa. In this way the lines of the initial 
group are somewhat expanded or contracted, but, as a rule, without chang- 
ing the original direction at any point. Thus:

pare last 4 tones with first 4. 

67. Further, the repetition or sequence may be partial; that is, con- 
sisting in the recurrence of only a portion of the original group. For 
illustration:

<*»s. Further, more rarely, the repetition or sequenoe may appear in a 
dUFerent rhythmic form. This very effective mode of reoiiRenoe is com- 
paratively harmless (not jeopardizing the reoognisabilitj of tho original 
group):— 

(1) If the sum ofbeaU remain* the tame; or 

(2) If tlit> sum is exactly <//>i'</»'</, or doubled, BO that tho prosodic ar- 
rangement (of aooented and unaccented tones) in not altered. Thus:

Ex. 61. 




3. Lento. (Ex. 58, Vo. L) 
Jt -^-, . . . 




4-. JHr^ro. (Ex. 52, No. #). 




09, Further, still more rarely, the recurrence by repetition or sequence 
may appear in a different rhythmic location, i. p.., on other beats of tho 
measure. This shifting of the measure, and consequent alteration of tho 

original prosodic effect, is a very misleading device, and belongs, properly, 

only to the higher ranges of composition; for a time, yet, it should be 
avoided by tho student, unless ho oan succeed in obviating total confusion 
of measure. 

It may result: — 

(1) From such parHat recurrences as wero shown in Ex. 60, No. 1; or 



HXXRCI8B8 IN MRTjODY-WIUTINa. 47 

(2) From adopting a group which contains, originally, less or more becda 
than the number contained in a fundamental rhythmic group. 

It is least objectionable when the irregular recurrence appears Bereral 
tinios in succession, — until the original rhythmic location is regained. For 
illustration:

LESSON 12. 

A large number of 4 and 8-measure melodies, with recurrences of tone- 
groups, by repetition or sequence, modified in the manners illustrated. 
Each device is to be exercised successively, in the order given above. 
Major and minor alternately; various species of Measure, from 2/4 to 12/8. 
No changes of key. 

After correction, a few of these melodies may be harmonized. 



CHAPTER XII. 

MELODIC SYNTAX, CONTINUED. 

THE PERIOD, RESUMED. 



71. The recurrence by Sequence may be utilized on a broad scale, as a 
guide for the movements of the Consequent Phrase of a Period-form. In this 
case again, as in par. 52, the construction is "parallel," the only difference 
being, that "sequence" is substituted for "repetition," in the conduct of 
the second Phrase. 

The sequential formation need not be exact; it is far more likely to be 
merely an approximate guide for the Consequent Phrase. And it need not, 
generally will not, extend through the entire Consequent, but through o 
portion only. Thus:

N. B.— In Nos. 1 and 2 of the above example, the cadence-tones are not defined 
Moording to the rules of Chapters VII and IX; but the pupil can easily (and must, yet 
awhile) adjust his own exercises to those rules. 



72. Analogously, the device of recurrence in Contrary direction (par, 70) 
may be applied on the same broad scale, to the (•(instruction of the Conse* 
qui nt Phrase; — possibly throughout the latter, though mnch more probably 
during s portion, only, of its length; and, almost certainly, with some free* 
doin in regard to the modifications explained in par. 66. 

Such melodies are known as Periods of "opposite construction"; com- 
pare pan. 52 and 53. For example: 



Ex. 66

See alao. " TONK-KKLATIOK8," Lobsou 18, No. 7 ; 22, No. 3 ; 27, No. 1 ; i8, No. 6. 



LESSON 13. 

A large number of 8-measure melodies in Period-form, applying the 
devices of sequence, and of contrary direction, for such a portion of the 
Consequent Phrase as will not interfere with the given rules of the ca- 
dences. 

The extent of coincidence (either as sequence, or in the opposite direc- 
tion) is to be shortened, gradually, in the later exercises, similar to the 
manner dictated in par. 53, — until no more than brief figures (3 or 4 tones) 
of the Consequent are derived from the corresponding measures of the 
Antecedent; — not necessarily the beginning; the derivation may occur at 
any point. 

Major and minor alternately. 

All species of Measure, up to 9/8 or 9/4. 

No changes of key. 

Beview, carefully, the directions given in Lesson 8, and apply them, 
where suitable. 



CHAPTER XIII. 
ALTERED SCALE -STEPS; MAJOR. 

73. The Scale-line may be modified by the chromatic Inflection 
of certain steps ; or by the Substitution of such chromatically inflected 
steps for the corresponding original ones. 

N. B. — A chromatic progression is the inflection of a letter, by means of an Acci- 
dental 

The chromatic inflections are to be effectuated strictly in accordance 
with what are known as the "Altered Scale-steps."

77. Tlie inflected tones are not to bo considered as changes of the key, 
nor allowed to cancel the prevailing scale. They are controlled in their 
movements by the impression of the given key (or scale), which is to re- 
main the satin- throughout each Phrase or Period-melody, — for the present.

LESSON 14. 

A number of 4 and 8-moasure melodies, in Major, with occasional in- 
flected Steps. The alterations must not be so brief as to appear to be 
"grace-notes" only, but must be obviously essential tones; as a rule, not 
less fckan a full beat in length, occasionally longer. No changes of key are 
to take place (par. 77). 

The first few exercises are to contain the best altered tones, and the 
regular modes of treatment; then experiments may be made with the more 
exceptional forms. Review par. 9a; par. 30; par. 39.

CHAPTER xv. 

MODULATION. OB CHANGES OF KEY. 

HI. A melody may be OOnduoted sway from the line of its own scale, 
Into tlmt of mbm other key. This effects ;i Bo-called Modulation. 

The cbango of sonic may l>e permanent, or it may be only temporary. 
In the tir.st ease, the melody, after pausing orer into tlie new key, makes its 
perfect eadenoe npon the Tonic of the latter. (See "Tomb-Bklaxioks,''*!] 
of Lessons 88 and 89.) When, on the other hand, the modulation is tem- 
porary (or transient, as it is called), the melody follows the line of the new 

wale only for B time (■ few bents), and thru returns to the Original key. 
(See "Tone-Relations," nil of Lesson 40.) 

H'2. BUUI I. — The original scale should bo exchanged only for that 
of a Mrf.ratotaf bay. Of these there are live, namely: one with the mum 
signature, two with the next higher, and two with the next lower signature 
(i. e. oue sharp more or less, or oue flat more or less). Thus:

N B. — Capital lottOTl indicate major 1>> ft ; small letters, minora. 

83. Rule II. — The change of key may bo made at any point in the 
Phrase, upon either an aooented or an unaccented beat. But it must, — at 
pre .ut, — take place after one of the three tones which constitute the Tonic cJiord, 



kXKltCISES IN ttfiLObY-WlirTlNG, 



t e., either after the 1st, the 3rd, or the 5th Step of the momentary scale 
(namely, the Inactive steps, par. 5). Thus:

-* * v ^t mtiniext — Q~3 1~ I -| ^ mton»xt- — n 



C-major. 



84. Rule III. — The deflection of the melody into the desired scale 
may, — after reaching one of the Inactive tones indicated in Rule II, — be 
effected by passing through any one of the five tones which constitute the chord 
of the Dominaut-9th, i. e., either the 5th, 7th, 2nd, 4th, or Gth Scale-steps of 
the desired key; — in other words, an entrance may be effected into the de- 
sired key through any other than its 1st and 3rd Scale-steps. (Even these may 
be used, as will bo seen in time; but not at present.) 

The most powerful of these "modulatory tones" is the 7th Scale-step 
(the so-called Leading-tone) ; still, all five are equally adequate, if properly 
approached and properly treated. 

85. (a) If possible, the last tone of the first key (one of the Inactive 
Steps given in Rule II) should be transformed mentally into a Scale-step of the 
prospective key. The melody then runs on, from the footing thus secured in 
the new scale, in exact accordance with former rules. For illustration:

(b) The most satisfactory result is gained (as far as the melody itself is 
concerned) by using, as soon as the new key is entered, a tone, or a group of 
tones, which indicates very distinctly the Dominant harmony of the key,—

80. If this montal transformation (pur. 85a) is not possible: that is, if 
thf lust tone of one scale dou not btiong t<> t/f coating ivy, then a chromatic 
progression will need to be made, at that point, — by simply inserting an 
accidental (see par. 73, N. B.). Thus:

87. (a) If such a chromatic movement be necessary, it should be fore- 
«een, and properly approached, i. e., in the corresponding direction. Thus:

(b) Or, the chromatic progression may be prepared by a wide leap from 
the opposite side, involving a change of direction, according to par. 2G. 
Thus: 

C 1 C — i

IN MELODY-WIUTINO. 



61 



xc; Or, finally, the chromatic inflection may be avoided, in the melody 
itself, by moving step-wise in the opposite direction. This involves the as- 
sumption of a Diminished-7th chord (i. e., the Incomplete Dominant-9th, in 
its minor form), — where the new key begins; and implies that the chromatic 
tone is taken up in some other part of the harmonic body. Thus:

88. Whether the foreign tones in a melody are merely inflected Scale- 
steps (i. e. altered tones), or the indicators of Modulation (i. e., change of 
entire scale, into that of another key), depends 

(1) Partly upon the location of the foreign tone in the prevailing key; 
for in order to serve as altered Step, it must conform to the lists given for 
major and minor in Exs. 66 and 76. But, 

(2) It also depends, much more largely (very often entirely^upon the

CHAPTER XVI. 
MODULATION, CONTINUED. 

Hi). The process of modulation is precisely tho same for trantiemi 

changes of key, as for tho permanent ones illustrated in tho preceding 
lesson. 

(a) In phrases in the smaller varieties of Measure, only one transient 
modulation is feasible, as a rule; i. e., the melody passes soon into ono of 
the five next-related keys, and, after a few beats, returns and closes upon 
tho Tonic of the original key. Thus: 



Ex.88.

A number of 4-nieasure melodies in Phrase-form: 

A. In the smaller species of Measure, with one transient modulation, 
and return (par. 89 a). 

I?. In larger Measures, with two or more transient modulations, and 
return (par. *9b). 



CHAPTER XVII. 



MODULATION, PERIOD-FORMS. 



OO. Changes of key may occur in the Period-form, at any point in 
either Phrase; but they are likely to have especial bearing upon the semi- 
cadence, which may be made upon either one of the three tones of the Tonic 
Triad (Steps 1, 3 or 5) of a next-related key. 

The best and most common keys selected for the semicadence are, 

The Dominant key (one sharp more, or one flat less, than the 
original signature); and 

The Relative key (the same signature). 

The Dominant key is particularly appropriate for the semicadence of 
a Period beginning in major; the Relative key for one beginning in minor:

MODULATION, CHROMATIC. 

91. The change of key may be effected contrary to Rule II (par. 83),— 
namely, after other than the Inactive 1st, 3rd or 5th Steps of the key, — on 
condition 

That the melody progress chromatically, from the Step chosen to 
close the first key, into a proper tone of the desired key (Rule III,

there is a pause in the melodic movement (a tone of comparatively long dura- 
tion), which affords timo to apprehend tho transformation (Ex. 92, Nos. 3 
and 6; Ex.91, No. 5). 

This, it is true, will usually result as a matter of course from tho 
application of tho strict rules given in Chapter XV; but it has a much 
wider operation, and extends to many cases not included in these rules.

LESSON 20. 

A nnmbor of 4 and 8-mea.snre melodies, with modulations throngn 
common tones (by overlapping scales), as explained above. At first into 
next-related keys only. Then experiments may also be made with more 
remoto keys. The general harmonic (chord) basis must bo kept well in 
mind. 



CHAPTER XX. 



MODULATION IN SEQUENCES, AND AT CADENCES. 

05. The broadest range of exceptional modulations is that afforded 

(1) By sequential recurrences (par. 64); and 

(2) By taking advantage of any sufficiently well-defined pause, or break 
(or cadence), in the line of the melody. Sequential recurrences generally 
involve, of themselves, such "breaks" in the melodic line,— at tho points 
of contact. Tho " breaks, " or cadences, may, however, bo created by many 
other means. For example:

LESSON 21. 

A number of 4 and 8-measure melodies, with modulations in sequences, 
and at cadences or interruptions, as shown above. The transitions may be 
made either into next-related or remote keys, at option; and the melodies 
may close in any key, — best, however, upon the original Tonic. All species 
of measure. The sequences, and all breaks in the line of the melody, must 
be distinctly defined. 

A few melodies may finally bo made, extending beyond the regular 4. or 
8-measure dimension (5, G.--9, 10, 12 measures in length). 



CHAPTER XXI. 
CHROMATIC MELODY. 



9G. The principle of chromatic succession enunciated in par. 91 may be 
extended to a longer series of chromatic tones, — generally in similar direc- 
tion. Such chromatic lines may represent a succession of brief and abrupt 
changes of key; or, as is far more likely, they may embody simply the prin- 
ciple of altered Stejjs (Chapters XIII and XIV). 



BXSB0ISE8 IN MELODY-WH1TINO. 



71 



In the latter case, though they assert themselves (by their tdme-varties) 
as essential tones, they prove to be, in reality, no more than intermediate 
tones, inserted between the tones of certain chord-lines in such a manner as 
not to overpower the impression of tho prevailing key. For illustration:

CHAPTER XXII. 

Tin: DOUBLE-PERIOD. 

97. Tlio Double-period generally embraces 10 measures; that is, four 
Phrases of four measures cadi, closing respectively with cadences in the 
4th, sth, 13th ami 16th measures. Compare par. 50. 

i>8. fa) The first of these is a light scmicadencc, and may be made 
nj)on any St. tp of the original key, as no modulation is likely to occur 
during the first Phrase of this longer design. 

fb) The scrawl one is apt to be a perfect cadence, falling upon the 

Tonic note of some next-related key, — best, as indicated in par. 90, the 

Dominant key (most commonly in a major melody), or the Relative key 

(usually in a minor melody); or perhaps the Relative of the Dominant; very 

either the Sub-dominant or its Relative, 

(c) The third one is again a light semicadence, and may fall upon any 
tono of the Tonic Triad (Steps 1, 3 or 5) of that next-related key into which 
tho melody may have boen conducted; for, during the third Phrase, modu- 
lations may be freely mads among any of the next-related keys, — rarely to 
remote keys. The best keys for this cadence are, either the Sub-dominant 
or its Relative. 

(d) The fourth Phrase may also modulate freely, for a measure or two, 
but must then turn back definitely into the original scale, and must close, 
naturally, with tho regular perfect cadence, upon the original key-note. 

SM). (a) The designs given in Chapter VTT, in reference to parallel and 
mtrasting construction (par. 52 and B8), must be closely followed in the

■ / PkraeeS must correspond (perhaps with a few slight ohanges) to Phrase 
1; and the g re a ter part of Phrase 4 must pursue the line of Phrase 2, — until 
the necessary difference of cadence asserts itself.

DIVISION TWO. 
UNESSENTIAL, OR EMBELLISHING, TONES. 



CHAPTER XXIII. 

DISTINCTION BETWEEN ESSENTIAL AND UNESSENTIAL 
TONES. 

100. Not all the tones in a melody need be essential, i. e., calling for 
special consideration in the process of harmonization. Many tones may be, 
and generally are, no more than unessential adjuncts of the principal (i. e. t 
the essential or important) tones, which latter they merely serve either to 
connect or to embellish. 

Such embellishing tones have appeared in many of the foregoing illustrations, simply be- 
cause their employment in composition is so common that but very lew examples could be found 
in which they are absent. 

The distinction between Essential and Unessential tones is determined 
very largely by their length ; usually, a tone of the value of a full beat is a 
principal or essential one; and, of two, three, or four quick tones that con- 
stitute the subdivisions of a beat, one or more are almost certain to ha 
unessential. 

But this is only the general distinction. — the true one depending, afte*. 
all, upon the relation of the tones, whether short or long, to the prevailing 
chord-line. For illustration : 



1. ( all essential) 3. (x unessential) 



tiF

CI VI V I 



This being the case, it follows, here again, that a melody must be de- 
signed with strict regard to some harmonic basis, or subconscious chord- 
concept. (Review pars. 15, 23, 38.) The tones which agree with the momen- 
tary chord are the essential or harmonic tones; those which differ from it

THE SUSPENSION.

embellished 



This device is as simple as it is effective; and its result is invariably 
good, unless it be applied during some very irregular melodic progression, 
which the Suspension would probably aggravate. 

102. (a) As a rule, the Suspension may best be introduced in descending 
step-wise progressions; but it is also good in ascending step-wise succes- 
sions, especially when applied to tones which have a natural upward ten- 
dency, like the 7th soil, -step (Leading-tone), or raised Steps. 

(b) The obligatory movement of the Suspension forward into the essen- 
tial tone, is its Resolution (par. 7). 

(c) If irregularities of rhythm result, they may be redeemed by recur* 
rence, precisely as shown in par. 5Ga; see Ex. 100, Nos. 2 and 7. 

(d) Instead of using a tie, the tone may be struck again, as repetition: 




EXBRCIflKfl IN MRLODY-WRnTKO. 



77 



And in fact, in this form it may signify no more than simple tone- 
repetition, as indicated in par. 9 a, and practiced freely in all the preceding 
lessons. 

(e) When applied to single tones in a measure or group, the best gen- 
eral effect is obtained at accented beats (as in Ex. 98, Nos. 2, 6 and 9, and in 
the majority of the following illustrations). But it is possible at the begin- 
ning of any beat, especially when occ\irring repeatedly, either in immediate 
succession (Ex. 99), or as recurrence at corresponding points (see par. 
102 c). 

(f) If the tie, or reiteration, is applied at a skip in the melody, the 
result -will not be an inharmonic Suspension; but it will be correct if the 
tones represent some good chord-line. For general illustration:

LESSON 24. 

A. Take a numbrr of former 4 or 8-nieasure melodies, and embellish 
then with occasional Suspensions, where convenient and effective, according 
to the above directions and illustrations. 

D. Invent a number of 4 and 8-measure melodies (major and minor 

alternately) with special application of the Suspension. Use all ipeeiee of 

ire, and modulate at option. The pupil must not only hear each tone 

difttinotlj as he writes it, but must endeavor to realize tho chord-basis also 

(i. o., tho harmonic accompaniment). 



EXERCISES IN MELODY-WRITDJO. 



CHAPTER XXIV. 
THE ANTICIPATION. 



103. Rule II.— Any essential tono in tho original (Bimple) melodic 
concept, or any weighty tone, whether essential or not, may be anticipated 
upon a fraction of the preceding beat,— usually a very brief fraction. Thus:

■ 



EX Kill : l IN Ml I "Li WIUT1NO. 



r.. Al^ra 




N. B. — This embellishment involves tone-repetition from one beat into the next, as 
in the Suspension, and is often not distinguishable from the latter at all. The difference 
lies solely in the purpose, or conception, of the writer, but may manifest itself clearly 
through the following conditions: 

(1) The Anticipation is generally a very short tone; 

(2) It is not tied to the following repetition, but is re-struck; 

(3) If embellishment by Anticipation, the second of the two similar tones will be the 

essential one, and may progress in any manner; if embellishment by Suspen- 
sion, the second tone will prove to be the unessential one, and must progress 
step-wise. This, again, depends upon the chord-basis.

THE PASSING-NOTE. 



104. RtncE III. — Any skip of a third between two successive essential 
(or weighty) tones in a melody, may be filled out, or reduced to step-wise 
progression, by instating the intermediate scale-step as PaSftifig-note, Usu- 
ally the Passing-note takes exactly half the value of the first tone, but it 
may be less than this (rarely more) according to the desired rhythmic effect.

PASSING-NOTES, CONTINUED. 

106. A skip of & fourth may bo filled out, similarly, by inserting the 
two intermediate scale-steps successively, in the same direction. 

The two connected passing-notes may be both unaccented (i. e., located 
within the beat or rhythmic group of the first tone), or they may be disposed 
in any other manner between the two essential tones, according to the de- 
sired rhythmic effect. Compare par. 105, and par. 102c. For illustration:

107. Adjacent scale-steps may bo connected by the intermediate chro- 
nvitv tone (when the space is a whole step). Such chromatic passing-notes 
actually corroborate, in origin and purpose, the Altered scale-steps (Chapters 
XIII Mad XIV), and are therefore more common in ascending, than in de- 
scending, succession. They differ in effect from the Altered Steps, which are 
0— rmtiel tones, in being more transient, und therefore obviously tmtumtttd. 

For larger spaces, alternate diatonic and chromatic passing-notes niny 
bo used in immediate succession in the same direction. For example:

108. As the fourth is the widest interval that can occnr between con- 
tiguous chord-tones (namely, from the chord-fifth to the Root above), it 
follows that a line of intermediate passing-notes, inserted between still 
larger skips (5th, 6th, 7th or 8ve), can not consist exclusively of inharmonic 
tones, but most contain one or more chord-tones, also. The effect of the wliole 
conjunct group, however, will be that of unessential tones, especially in 
swift successions; and as such they are to be regarded and treated. For 
illustration (the * harmonic " passing-notes indicated by x in parenthesis):

109. The device of tone-repetition, employed throughout the foregoing 
lessons, may bo applied even to passing-notes. Such repeated passing-notes 
are best when they are of sufficient time-value, and importance, to be partly

CHAPTER XXVII. 



NEIGHBORING - NOTES. 



110. (a) Rule TV. — Any essential tone in a simple melodic line, or a 
weighty tone whether essential (harmonic) or not, may be embellished by 
placing either its higher or its lower Neighbor be/ore it. 

(b) Very frequently the essential tone precedes, as well as follows, the 
neighboring-tone, thus constituting an embellishing group of three tones 
(i. e. , the essential or principal tone and its recurrence, with the upper or 
lower neighbor between ; — or, in other words, the neighbor inserted between 
an ordinary tone-repetition). 

(c) The group may assume almost any rhythmic form; either of the 
three tones may occupy the accented fraction of a beat, and the values are 
optional. But the simplest, and by far the most common form, is that

111. The difference between the Neighboring-note and the Passing-note is, that the 
former turnt back into its own principal tone, while the latter passes on into another 
essential tone. Compare Ex. 103, No. 1, with Ex. 108, carefully. In other words, the 
embellishment with a neighboring-note involves only one essential or weighty tone; the 
passing-note, on the contrary, always involves two different essential tones. The former 
is therefore a local embellishment, the latter a progressive one. 

1 1 12. Whether tho upper or tbe lower neighbor is to be used, depends 
somewhat upon the location of the following tone in the original melodic line. 
Tho rules are: 

(1) If the formation of the group is to be Regular, the upper neighbor 
is taken when the next tone lies below; and, vice versa, the lower neighbor 
when the following tone lies higher; — or, in other words, that neighbor is 
chosen which lies opposite the coming tone. In this way, the impetus 
imparted to tho final tone in the group by its embellishing neighbor, carries 
it naturally toward tho next tone. Thus: 



Ex. 109.

exceptional- 



S3 



^^^ 



Or (2), in a series of such groups, each may bo turned the same way, 
irrespective of the direction into the next essential tone. In this case, some 
of the groups will be Irregular, — but their irregularity is counteracted, as 
usual, by "uniform recurrence" (par. 56a). For example:

N. B. — In any case, tho rhythmic arrangement of such successive (or corresponding) 
groups is almost certain to be uniform. 



1 1.'5. Further, the noUUion of tho neighboring-notes is subject to the 

following rules: 

(1) The u}>per neighbor must always agree with the lino of the prevail- 
ing scale. Thus:

(2) The lower neighbor may also agree in notation with the lino of the 
prevailing scale, and in melodies of a serious or stately character (or when 
the neighboring note is long) it does so. But ordinarily, especially in 
graceful or rapid melodies, the lower neighbor lies a half-step below its prin- 
dpd Ume, irrespective of key; — excepting when the principal tone is tho 7th

LESSON 28. 

A. A number of simple melodies in uniform, rhythm (from the first five 
lessons), to be embellished with 3-tone groups, as shown above. 

They may be applied to an occasional single tone, in which case the 
rhythmic effect must be guarded; if unaccented beats are broken, the rhythm 
will be regular; if irregular, from any cause, the rhythm must be rectified 
by "recurrence." 

Or the groups may appear continuously, i. e., at each tone throughout 
the melody, generally excepting the final (cadence) tone; this will constitute 
a " Bunning part." 

B. New melodies, 4 and 8 measures, in various species of Measure, 
major and minor alternately, with special reference to the 3-tone group. 
The material of former lessons must not be neglected.

CHAPTER XXIX. 

NEIGHBORING-NOTE AS APPOGGIATURA. 

llf». The neighboring-note, instead of appearing thus ?)p(>re/m reitera- 
tions of its principal ton<\ may, moreover, be placed simply hqfort the lat- 
ter, — p rmst din g it only, as prefixed grace-note, and forming an embellishing 
group of but A«0 tones (oompsre par. 110a and b). In this connection it is 
Bailed an A p poggiatUTUt lta details are subject to the rules given in 
Chapter XXVII. 

(1) The rhythmic form, and the location, of the 2-tone group are op- 
tional; but the appoggiatura is most commonly placed upon the aooented 

fraction of the beat (like the suspension, or the accented passing-note, and, 
like these, changing the original location of the essential tone by shifting it 
forward); and the appoggiatura is quito frequently longer than its principal 
tone. For example:

(2) Tho choice between upper or lower neighboring-note, as appoggia- 
tura, may be determined, primarily, by the rules given above;— i a., either 

aooording to the direction into tho following essential tone (see Ex. 117, 
tfoa, »'>, 7, 9 and 11); or in uniform figures, as in Ex. 117, Nos. 2 and S. But, 
in practical composition, the utmost freedom is exercised in this choice. 
Tn g e ner a l, the upper neighbor is the more common. The prreatest influence 
rted by the location of the preceding tone; for instance: 



EXEBCT8ES IN MF.TiODY-WRTTTNQ. 99 

An upward movement (especially with a skip) is usually made to the 
upper appoggiatura; and a downward progression to the lower one, — of the 
following tone, of course. This simply corroborates the rule given in par. 
28 a, and again in par. 75 c; i. e., the appoggiatura is best approached (from 
any distance) in the direction opposite to that of its Resolution (its obligatory 
step-wise progression into its principal tone). For illustration:

This rule prevails almost throughout Ex. 117; the only exceptions occur 
in No. 5 (second measure), and in No. 8 (second half of each measure). 

(3) The notation of the appoggiatura is defined exactly according to the 
rules given in par. 113 (Exs. Ill and 112). 

(4) The presence of an appoggiatura justifies exceptions to the rule of 
successive skips in the same direction, given in par. 31 (Ex. 25, Nos. 6, 11, 
12, 13, 14). For example:

CHAPTER XXX. 
DOUBLE-APPOGGIATURA 

11(5. (a.) In a similar manner, and with similar, though much height- 
en. •<!. affect, both the upper and lower neighbor may successively precede their 
mutual principal tone, as Douhl^-uppoggintura. The first nppoggiatura does 
not progress directly into its principal tone, but passes first over to the oppo- 
site neighbor (of the same principal tone), thus producing a new variety of 
the 3-tone group. Compare Ex. 108; and observe the distinction between 
this use oi both neighbors, and that illustrated in Ex. 115. 

For example: 



Ex.120.

(b) As usual, the group may appear in any reasonable rhythmic form; 
either of tho 3 tones may occupy the accented fraction of the beat or rhyth- 
mic group; and the time-values are almost wholly optional. The details of 
treatment conform to the rules and illustrations of the preceding chapter.

A. A number of former melodies, to be embellished -with the Double 
appoggiatura, in the 3-tone and 4-tone groups above illustrated; eitha

B. New melodies, 4 and 8 measures, major and minor, in various specie 
of Measure, with special reference to this form of embellishment. 



CHAPTER XXXI. 

APPOGGIATURAS, CONTINUED. 

119. The Double-appoggiatura sometimes appears in connection with 
the Suspension, as "indirect Resolution " of the latter. The Suspension, as 
is made manifest in Chapter XXIII, is always a neighbor of the following 
essential tone, — because of its invariable application at a step-wise progres- 
sion, — either above or below. Hence, it may be regarded as an appoggia- 
tura, and be conducted first into the opposite neighbor, before the essential 
tone follows, precisely as shown in par. 116 a. For example: 




106

Hi initial liu.

l -O. The strict rulo of tho neighboring-note, as Men thronghont tho 
pxeeeding ohepten, is, that it must befoBotoed By a ttep- wt$t Rt $o luH tm into 

its prinfijml tone,— either Immediately, or after nwinging over into tho 
oppoait • neighbor ol that principal tone. 

(a) A peculiar, but quite oommon, exoeptfan to this rulo is, that the 
wpper neighboring-note, after properly following its principal tone, may 

lctj< down a 3rd. In other words, the vpper neighbor may iuterveuo be- 
tweeo two principal tunes that represent a dmeending ttep^wite progression. 
The remit il best when tho principal tones are both harmonic; but it is 
applicable to any weighty tones, even when one, or each of them, is a pass- 
ing-note. 

This. — tho "Unresolved,"— neighboring-note is alwm/s unaccented, and 
usually atari (liko the anticipation, which it most resembles in origin and 
charact.-r). Thus:

CHAPTER XXXII. 
EVOLUTION OF MELODIC GERMS. 



121. The application of these various classes of embellishments is apt, 
in many cases, to be determined upon some broader basis than the general 
purpose of ornamenting individual tones of a simple melodic line. 

The development or evolution of an elaborate melodic figure, or com- 
plete Phrase, out of two or three fundamental tones, by miscellaneous 
methods of embellishment and repetition, has been repeatedly exhibited in 
the foregoing examples; and while such products are not, as a rule, in 
advanced musical thought, the result of deliberate intention, they are none 
the less surely thus simple in their original germinal form, and must have 
existed in this simple form in the firmly established melodic habits of the 
composer, — even when they appear to have issued spontaneously from his 
mind, directly, in their complete ornate and characteristic shape. 

This process of melodic evolution is so natural and so wholesome, and 
the evidences of its presence in classic melodic thought are so clear, so posi- 
tive and so instructive, that its systematic exercise is of vital importance to 
the student who aims to acquire habits of healthy and facile melodic 
conduct. 

The only rules are: that the fundamental tones (the germ) shall form a 
perfectly f/udtless and natural melodic figure, at least free from extreme 
irregularities; and that the manipulation of it into an ornate Phrase shall 
be coherent, smooth, well-balanced (as concerns the rhythmic and syntactic 
exterior), and free from eccentricity. 

122. Hence, an ornate melodic sentence may conceal (perhaps so clev- 
erly that its presence may scarcely be heard, — though it is certain to be 
felt) a part of the line of the scale; or the simplest elements of the Tonic 
chord, or Dominant chords. 

The following illustrations are to be very studiously examined and

123. Such simple germs, derived directly from the scale, or from some 
primary chord-line, are, — like the soil, — common property, open to the use 
of all humanity. 



EXEItCISKS IN MELODY-WRITING. 



115 



In the choice of these germs no originality can bo exercised, or proven, — 
merely common souse. 

But their manipulation,— VtR method, and the extent, of their embel- 
lishment and development,— exhibits the individuality of the cr/mposer, the 
particular quality and calibro of his innate mnsieal susceptibility, or the 
degree of discrimination and "taste" that he has acquired by persistent and 
thorough exercise of such established technical methods as those expounded 
in the present treatise, — that may possibly lead onward into yet undiscovered 
modes of treatment. 

This is one of the most obvious and natural phases of the apparently 
occult, but in reality very manifest, Science of Originality.

CHAPTER XXXIV. 
MELODIC EXPRESSION. CONCLUSION. 

125. As stated in the Preface, the foregoing is a course of systematic 
exercise in melody invention, only, — not melody conception. For the latter 
there is, and should be, no other guide than the individual impulses of the 
maturing composer, founded upon, and controlled by, such natural and 
correct habits of melodic thought as he may have been fortunate enough to 
establish iu early youth. 

The transition from invention into conceptior is signalized by the in- 
creasing assertion of personal emotional impulses {feeling, as distinguished 
from thought), through which the element called Expression is instilled into 
the otherwise purely mechanical product, and the distinctions of Style, both 
individual and general, are created. 

126. The presence of this element of Expression is manifested by an 
independent inclination to discriminate between the following attributes of 
musical style: — 

(a) Between the major and minor Modes; — the latter of which is 
more passionate and sombre, the former brighter and more vigorous in effect, 
as a common rule. 

(b) Between the duple and triple species of fundamental Rhythm ; 

the former more sturdy, the latter more graceful. 

(c) Between rapid and slow Tempo, or degree of fundamental motion. 
This distinction influences, somewhat, even the technical formation of the 
melodic sentence; — in slow, or moderate, tempi, there is likely to be more 
scale than chord-derivation ; considerable ornamentation is appropriate and 
necessary, and much — even extreme — diversity of tone-values is possible. 
On the contrary, in more active or rapid tempi, c&ortf-derivation is apt to 
predominate over scale-derivation, though rapid scale-passages (as embel- 
lishment by passing-notes) are by no means infrequent; less ornamentation 
is likely to appear, and diversity of time-values is more limited, i. e. f the 
rhythm is more nearly uniform. 

(d) Between such conventional Styles as distinguish one class of com- 
position from another (i. e. , the Waltz from the Nocturne, the March from 
the Barcarolle, etc.). These are subject to no other laws than those of con- 
vention, or popular usage, and are best learned by observation. 

127. All of these general qualities of melodic conception demand the 
more advanced discipline of musical Form, and can therefore be exercised 
only experimentally and briefly, at the discretion of the teacher, in the 
present course of melodic practice.

l -\K The details of melodie afleeta, irhioh And their parallels in the 
nn.liihitions of poetic erpr o aaion, may be deaeribed approximately m fol- 
lowa: 

(<i) An amtnchng qno ccaai on ol tour-,, tlong the scale-line, indiealea, 
ordinarily, an increase of emotional tension, or emphasis; a deteenohng mo* 
01 anion, • nation, 

(b) The effect of ttep-wiee progressions is that of gradual and smooth 
change, morease or decrease of the djegree or stress of feeling. Whereat, 
when the tones progress in tkipe, either way, these ohangea of feeling are 
more tibru],t and positive, about in proportion to the size of the skips. 

(c) The progression in chromatic tones is more se<luctir>> <>>• }>,issian<a>>, as 
a rule, than diatonic (i. e., scale) successions, and usually in proportion to 

their speed. 

(d) The changes in force indicated by tretcendo and diminuendo, arouse 
exactly similar impressions of increasing or decreasing volume or emphasis 
of feeling; the extremes of fortissimo and />ionissimo indicate, respectively, 
utmost power or HfloniW, and utmost gentleness or remoteness. 

(e) Siuklen changes of force {nl>ruj>t forte, or piano effects) corroborate 
swift, perhaps violent, impulses of em6tion; these may be emphasized by 
simultaneous sndden changes of register or pitch, — i. e., wide skips, the 
effect of winch, M stated at />, is similarly abrupt and vigorous. 

(f) The musical sense of a tone is powerfully influenced by its location 
and value in the rhythmic group. If it bo placed upon the acc en te d beat, 
or if its time-value be increased, such musical meaning as it possesses 
(absolute or comparative), is brought out with corresponding force. And, 
on the other hand, its location upon an unac c e nt ed beat, or its contraction to 
a brief time-value, diminishes the effect and value of its musical meaning. 

(g) The definition of tonal meanings, and the bearing of the above upon 
them, may be roughly stated thus: 

The chord-root is p o w erfu l; the chord-third sweeter and more flexible; 
the chord-fifth soft and tender. If placed upon the accented beats, or 
lengthened, they impart these respective qualities to the entire rhythmic 
group in which they occur. 

The chord-7th and 9th, and the suspensions, are keen, conspicuous, 
and even obtrusive (in proportion to the degree of their dissonance); if 
accented, their effect is heightened; if prolonged, the effect of strain or ten-

sion is created. Appoggiaturas aro similar, but usually still more pro- 
nounced iu effect. 

These, and other, distinctions may be tested iu the melodic examples 
given in this book, some of which should be reviewed with special reference 
to the quality of Expression. 

130. The principal rules of vocal setting are: 

I. That the rhythmic details in the melody should agree closely with 
the prosodic effects of the text; i. e., accented syllables and important words 
should be set to the comparatively accented, higher, or longer, tones; and, 
vice versa, unaccented syllables and unimportant words should be set to 
comparatively unaccented, lower, or shorter, tones. 

II. That the emotional contents of the text should be corroborated, by 
consistent employment of the distinctions of melodic expression above 
explained. 

III. That notes set to separate words or syllables must be detached, in 
notation; while two or more notes set to one word or syllable must be con- 
nected, either by beam, tie, or slur. 

The following examples briefly illustrate these rules. The pupil may 
find numerous others, in English Oratorios, Cantatas, Anthems and Songs 
(i. e., composed originally to English words):

LESSON 35. 

The melodio setting of linos, and of brief stanzas, from church hymn- 
books; or from tbo Psalms and other parts of tho Bible; or from secular 
poetic writings. At first, a few BZeroieei in Recitative form, i. e., not strictly 
metrical. Afterwards, very numerous studies in metrical Phrase, Period, or 
Double-period form. 

After correction and approval by tho teacher, they may bo harmonized, 
or provided with a simple instrumental accompaniment.
